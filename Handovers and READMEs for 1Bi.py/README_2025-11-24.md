# Project status 2025-11-24

**Project** AI_Financial_Sims/HO  
**Report date** 2025-11-24

## Canonical sources
- **Current canonical script**  
  HO 1st time 5080/train_phase2b2_HO.1B.py

- **Active candidate**  
  feature/train_phase2b2_HO.1Bi -> HO_train_phase_ANNs/Handovers and READMEs for 1Bi.py/train_phase2b2_HO.1Bi.py

## Provenance and file policies
- All new or overwritten source files must have:
  - a timestamped .bak created before the write,
  - a lowercase .sha256 sidecar written atomically,
  - a single focused commit containing the script, its .sha256, and the HANDOVER manifest.
- Sidecar hex casing policy: **lowercase**.

## Run policy
- Begin every run with HANDOVER.RUN.manifest.json describing inputs and expected outputs.
- Perform a smoke-run using deterministic_inference.infer_with_model to produce preds.json and preds.sha256.
- Only after smoke-run verification and HANDOVER index append should full training be executed.

## Current state
- master rebased and pushed; artifact files removed from index in commit 5b9170f.
- Candidate 	rain_phase2b2_HO.1Bi prepared as a copy of canonical 1B (feature branch workflow).
- Retired artifacts remain in etired_ANN_files and must not be used as canonical sources.

## Next actions
1. Decide whether to create the candidate files now or to review the manifest and CSV inputs first.
2. If proceeding: create feature branch, copy canonical 1B to 1Bi, create .bak and .sha256, create HANDOVER.RUN.manifest.json, run smoke-run, record outputs, append to HANDOVER.INDEX, then merge to master.
3. If history purge is required later, plan a coordinated git-filter-repo or BFG workflow and announce a freeze window.

## Contacts and accountability
- **Owner** Brian (you) — final approval for any file writes or history rewrite.
- **Backups** keep ackup-before-rebase and other backup branches until transfer is complete.
