Purpose:
Train HO phase ANN and produce predictions artifact for downstream evaluation.

Operational notes:
- Data and artifact paths are network mounted at \\10.0.0.5
- Ensure read access to data and write access to artifact path
- Recommended Python environment: 3.9+, with numpy, pandas, torch/tensorflow, scikit-learn
- If running on Windows, ensure UNC paths are accessible to the service account

Files included in handover directory:
- README-1Bi.md (human readable instructions)
- HANDOVER-1Bi.json (machine readable metadata)
- train_phase2b2_HO.1Bi.py (source code in repository)

Suggested actions for Claude automation:
1. Verify artifact presence and SHA256 checksum.
2. If artifact valid, copy artifact to target storage or trigger downstream evaluation.
3. If artifact missing or checksum mismatch, flag for human review and include logs.
